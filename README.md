## Locale Contributing
Want to help translate Tails Club into another language? Awesome! Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new JSON file with the locale name as the file name (example: en.json or es.json)
3. Copy and paste everything from en.json into your file
4. Keep the left column (the JSON keys) as English, and replace the right column (the JSON values) with your translations
5. Submit a pull request with your changes

NOTE: Any time you see ```%s```, it is a placeholder. It will be replaced with something else, such as dynamic content or a URL. Please keep this in mind in your translations.

Thank you for your help in translating Tails Club!
